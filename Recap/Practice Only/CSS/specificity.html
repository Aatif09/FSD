    <h2>CSS Specificity: Multiple Combinations</h2>

    <p>This text is styled by the type selector (should be overridden by the universal selector and turn pink).</p>

    <p class="important-text">This text is styled by the class selector (should be overridden by the universal selector and turn pink).</p>

    <p id="unique-text">This text is styled by the ID selector (should be overridden by the universal selector and turn pink).</p>

    <p class="important-text" id="unique-text">This text has both class and ID selectors (should be overridden by the universal selector and turn pink).</p>

    <p class="important-text" style="color: purple;">This text has an inline style (should be purple).</p>

    <p id="unique-text" class="important-text" style="color: purple;">This text has both class and ID selectors, plus inline style (should be purple).</p>

    <p>This text is styled by the type selector and universal selector (should be pink due to !important).</p>

    <p class="important-text" id="unique-text">This text has the highest specificity without inline styles (should be black, but !important makes it pink).</p>

    <h3>Notice how the colors are applied based on specificity.</h3>
