content="width=device-width": This sets the width of the viewport to be equal to the device's screen width. So, if you're viewing the page on a mobile phone, it will adjust to the width of the phone screen, not a desktop screen.
initial-scale=1.0: This sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded. A value of 1.0 means that the page will not be zoomed in or out and will be displayed at its actual size. -->

    <h2>Understanding Div and Span</h2>
    <div class="div-box">
      This is a block-level element (div). It takes up the full width of the
      container.
    </div>
    <p>
      This is a paragraph with a
      <span class="span-text">highlighted word</span> using the inline
      <code>alert('Hello, World!');</code> element
    </p>
    <div class="div-box">
      Another block-level div. Each div starts on a new line and spans the full
      width.
    </div>
  </body>

<!-- Regular text: The text "span" is treated as any other word, and the browser displays it normally.
With <code>: The text "span" is now semantically marked as code, and browsers typically display it in a monospace font, making it visually distinct as a technical term. -->
